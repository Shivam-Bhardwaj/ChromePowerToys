# ChromePowerToys: Project Roadmap & Feature Tracks

Welcome to the ChromePowerToys project! Inspired by the utility of Windows PowerToys, our goal is to build a suite of powerful, safe, easy-to-use, and community-driven Chrome extensions. We aim to enhance productivity, customization, and the overall browsing experience, with a special interest in leveraging AI (preferably Google's Gemini family of models) to create intelligent browsing assistants.

This document outlines potential features and modules we aim to develop. It serves as a roadmap and a list of "TODOs" for the community, structured to be suitable for focused development efforts similar to GSoC projects.

## How to Contribute & Manage These TODOs Professionally

1.  **GitHub Issues for Tracking:**
    * Each distinct feature or significant sub-feature from the list below should ideally become a **GitHub Issue**. This allows for discussion, assignment, progress tracking, and linking to pull requests.
    * **Issue Templates:** We will create templates for bug reports, feature requests, and GSoC-style project proposals.
2.  **Labeling Issues:** (e.g., `module:ai-summarizer`, `type:feature`, `good-first-issue`, `ai-integration`, `needs-design`, `help-wanted`)
3.  **GitHub Projects (Project Boards):** For visual task management.
4.  **Discussion Before Major Work:** Especially for GSoC-style projects, a proposal/discussion in an issue is crucial.
5.  **Contribution Guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`):** Outlining coding standards, PR processes, development setup, and a **Code of Conduct**.
6.  **Clear Documentation:** For users and developers. Each PowerToy needs its own `README.md`.
7.  **Emphasis on Safety & Ease of Use:**
    * **Safety:** Extensions must request minimal necessary permissions. Any data handling, especially with LLMs, must prioritize user privacy and be transparent. No unnecessary data collection.
    * **Ease of Use:** Intuitive UI/UX is paramount. Features should be discoverable and require minimal configuration for basic use.

### II. Content Interaction & Augmentation (High AI Potential Area)

This track focuses on extensions that interact with and enhance the content of web pages, with a strong emphasis on AI-driven capabilities.

* **Module: AI-Powered Content Insights (Core "Comet-like" Features)**
    * This module is central to our vision of an AI-assisted browsing experience.
    * **LLM Preference:** We aim to use Google's Gemini family of models. Contributors should explore the Gemini API. While self-hosting an LLM is a long-term interest, initial versions will rely on cloud APIs. All LLM interactions must be clearly indicated to the user, and data sent should be minimized to the necessary context.

    * **Project Idea: AI-Powered Summarizer**
        * **Detailed Description:** Develop an extension that can summarize the content of the current webpage or selected text. The user should be able to invoke the summarizer (e.g., via context menu or browser action) and see a concise summary. Options for summary length (short, medium, detailed) could be included.
        * **Success Metrics:**
            * Successfully summarizes articles from a diverse set of news sites, blogs, and documentation pages.
            * Summaries are coherent, accurate, and capture the main points of the source text.
            * Users can easily copy the summary.
            * The extension clearly indicates when it's processing and when content is sent to an LLM.
            * Minimal and clearly defined permissions are requested.
            * User interface is intuitive and non-intrusive.
        * **Potential Steps for Contributors:**
            1.  Research Chrome extension APIs for accessing page content (DOM, selection).
            2.  Set up access to the Gemini API (or chosen Google LLM).
            3.  Design the UI for invoking the summarizer and displaying results (e.g., popup, side panel).
            4.  Implement logic to extract relevant text from a page (stripping boilerplate like ads, navbars).
            5.  Implement the API call to the LLM, sending the text and appropriate prompts for summarization.
            6.  Handle API responses, including errors.
            7.  Display the summary to the user.
            8.  Develop settings for summary length or style (if applicable).
            9.  Write tests for core functionality.
            10. Document the extension's usage and data handling practices.

    * **Project Idea: AI-Powered Related Content Finder**
        * **Detailed Description:** Create an extension that analyzes the current webpage and suggests related articles, research papers, videos, or alternative viewpoints. The goal is to help users explore topics more deeply.
        * **Success Metrics:**
            * Suggestions are highly relevant to the content of the current page.
            * A variety of source types can be suggested.
            * Users can easily open suggested links.
            * The process of finding related content is reasonably fast.
            * Clear indication of LLM usage and data handling.
        * **Potential Steps for Contributors:**
            1.  Determine the best way to represent the current page's content for LLM analysis (e.g., main text, keywords, URL).
            2.  Design prompts for the Gemini API to find related content or topics. This might involve asking the LLM to generate search queries or identify key entities.
            3.  Optionally, integrate with search APIs (e.g., Google Custom Search JSON API, if appropriate and within terms of service) using LLM-generated queries.
            4.  Develop a UI to display related content suggestions (e.g., in a sidebar or browser action popup).
            5.  Implement caching mechanisms if appropriate to avoid redundant processing for the same page.
            6.  Ensure user privacy regarding browsing history used for suggestions.

    * **Project Idea: "Explain Like I'm 5" (ELI5) Mode using LLMs**
        * **Detailed Description:** Develop a feature that allows users to select complex text or an entire article and get a simplified explanation suitable for a layperson or a child.
        * **Success Metrics:**
            * Simplified explanations are accurate yet easy to understand.
            * The core meaning of the original text is preserved.
            * Users can easily trigger the ELI5 function on selected text or the whole page.
            * The UI for displaying the simplified text is clear.
        * **Potential Steps for Contributors:**
            1.  Allow users to select text or choose "whole page" mode.
            2.  Craft effective prompts for the Gemini API to rephrase text in simple terms without losing accuracy.
            3.  Design how and where the simplified explanation is displayed (e.g., overlay, side panel, replacing selection).
            4.  Handle potential issues with very long texts or highly technical jargon.

* **Module: Translation & Language Tools**
    * **Project Idea: AI-Powered Inline Translation Tool**
        * **Detailed Description:** Allow users to select text on any webpage and get an instant translation into their desired language. The translation should appear inline or in a small, non-intrusive popup. Users should be able to set a default target language.
        * **Success Metrics:**
            * Supports a wide range of source and target languages (leveraging the LLM's capabilities).
            * Translations are accurate and contextually appropriate.
            * The UI for triggering translation and viewing it is seamless.
            * Performance is good, with minimal delay for translation.
            * Securely handles user-selected text.
        * **Potential Steps for Contributors:**
            1.  Integrate with the Gemini API (or other Google translation services/LLMs) for translation.
            2.  Develop a robust way to capture selected text and its context.
            3.  Design the UI: context menu integration, hover popups, or a small fixed panel.
            4.  Manage language preferences for the user.
            5.  Implement error handling for API calls.

### I. Productivity & Workflow Enhancement

* **Module: Advanced Tab Management**
    * **Project Idea: "Workspaces" for Tab & Session Management**
        * **Detailed Description:** Allow users to define, save, and quickly switch between "workspaces." A workspace would consist of a defined set of open tabs (URLs), potentially across multiple windows, and could also include the state of specific tab groups. This helps users context-switch efficiently (e.g., "Work Project A," "Personal Research," "Social Media").
        * **Success Metrics:**
            * Users can easily create, name, and save the current tab/window layout as a workspace.
            * Users can quickly open/restore a saved workspace, replacing or adding to current tabs.
            * Workspaces are persistently stored (e.g., using `chrome.storage`).
            * The UI for managing workspaces (list, create, open, delete) is intuitive.
            * The extension is lightweight and doesn't significantly slow down the browser.
        * **Potential Steps for Contributors:**
            1.  Research Chrome APIs for tab management (`chrome.tabs`), window management (`chrome.windows`), and storage (`chrome.storage.local` or `chrome.storage.sync`).
            2.  Design the data structure for storing workspace information (list of URLs, window states, group info).
            3.  Develop the UI for creating, listing, loading, and deleting workspaces (e.g., via a browser action popup).
            4.  Implement the logic for capturing the current session state.
            5.  Implement the logic for restoring a saved workspace.
            6.  Consider options for how to handle conflicts if a workspace is loaded while other tabs are open (e.g., close existing, open in new window).
            7.  Add functionality to update existing workspaces.
