# ChromePowerToys: Supercharge Your Chrome Experience! üöÄ

Welcome to **ChromePowerToys**! Inspired by the utility and philosophy of Windows PowerToys, this project is dedicated to building a suite of powerful, safe, and easy-to-use Chrome extensions. Our mission is to help you transform your Google Chrome browser into a personalized powerhouse of productivity, organization, and intelligent browsing.

We are a community-driven initiative aiming to create a collection of high-quality, open-source tools. Many of our planned features involve leveraging AI, with a preference for **Google's Gemini family of models**, to provide intelligent assistance directly within your browser.

## ‚ú® Our Philosophy

* **Powerful & Useful:** Each "PowerToy" should solve a real user need or significantly enhance a common browsing task.
* **Safe & Secure:** User privacy and security are paramount. Extensions will request minimal necessary permissions. Any data handling, especially with AI services, will be transparent and prioritize user consent. No unnecessary data collection.
* **Easy to Use:** Intuitive design and straightforward functionality are key. Power doesn't have to mean complicated.
* **Community-Driven:** We thrive on contributions of all kinds ‚Äì ideas, documentation, code, design, and feedback. We aim to structure feature development in a way that's conducive to focused efforts, similar to projects in programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
* **Open Source:** All our code is open (MIT License by default, unless specified otherwise for a particular PowerToy) for anyone to inspect, use, modify, and contribute to.

## üõ†Ô∏è What are ChromePowerToys?

ChromePowerToys will be a collection of individual Chrome extensions, each designed to add a specific piece of "power" functionality to your browser. Users can choose to install only the PowerToys they need.

**Examples of planned PowerToys include:**
* AI-Powered Content Summarizer
* Advanced Tab & Session Management ("Workspaces")
* Customizable New Tab Page (Our first example!)
* Smart Clipboard Utilities
* And many more! (See our Roadmap)

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap & Feature Ideas

We have an ambitious list of features we'd like to build! From advanced tab management and AI-powered content summarization to privacy enhancers and developer utilities.

üëâ **See our detailed [Project Roadmap & Feature Tracks](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) to explore potential contributions and GSoC-style project ideas!** üëà

This roadmap outlines the different modules and specific PowerToys we envision.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Users)

As PowerToys are developed, you'll be able to install them directly into your Chrome browser.

1.  **Find a PowerToy:** Browse our [Project Roadmap](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) or the `code_examples/` directory for developed PowerToys.
2.  **Download:** For now, you might need to download the PowerToy's folder from this GitHub repository. Eventually, we aim to publish them on the Chrome Web Store.
3.  **Installation (for unpacked extensions):**
    * Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    * Enable **Developer mode** (usually a toggle in the top-right corner).
    * Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
    * In the file dialog, navigate to and select the specific PowerToy's folder (e.g., `ChromePowerToys/code_examples/simple_new_tab_extension/`).
    * Click "Select Folder".
    * The PowerToy extension should now appear in your list of extensions and be active!

*(Specific installation instructions for each PowerToy will be available in its own directory/README.)*

## üíª How to Contribute (For Developers & Enthusiasts) ‚ù§Ô∏è

We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether you're a seasoned developer, a UI/UX designer, a technical writer, or just someone with great ideas, there's a place for you here.

**1. Understand the Vision:**
   Start by reading this `README.md` and our [Project Roadmap & Feature Tracks](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) to get a feel for what we're trying to build.

**2. Find Something to Work On:**
   * **GitHub Issues:** This is the primary place for task management.
        * Look for issues tagged `good first issue` if you're new.
        * Look for issues tagged `help wanted` or `status:todo`.
        * Browse the [Project Roadmap](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) and see if a feature excites you. If there isn't an issue for it yet, you can propose one!
   * **Propose a New PowerToy/Feature:** If you have an idea for a new PowerToy that fits our philosophy, please [open a new "Feature Request" issue](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys/issues/new/choose) to discuss it with the community.

**3. Setting Up Your Development Environment:**
   * **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy.
   * **Clone Your Fork:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys.git`
   * **Navigate to the Directory:** `cd ChromePowerToys`
   * **(Optional) Create a new branch for your feature/fix:** `git checkout -b my-awesome-powertoy`
   * **Development:**
        * Each PowerToy will typically reside in its own sub-directory within `code_examples/` (or a future `powertoys/` directory).
        * Follow the standard Chrome extension development process (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, `manifest.json`).
        * Test your extension by loading it as an unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`.

**4. Coding Guidelines & Best Practices (to be detailed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`):**
   * **Keep it Simple:** Write clear, maintainable code.
   * **Focus on User Experience:** Ensure the PowerToy is intuitive and easy to use.
   * **Prioritize Security & Privacy:** Request only necessary permissions. Be mindful of data handling.
   * **Add Comments:** Explain complex parts of your code.
   * **Write/Update Documentation:** If you add a new feature, update the relevant READMEs.
   * **Consider AI Integration (Optional but Encouraged):** If your feature can be enhanced by AI (using Google's Gemini models), explore that possibility. Ensure any AI usage is transparent to the user.

**5. Making a Contribution:**
   * **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages (see our `.gitmessage.txt` template if you've configured it).
   * **Push to Your Fork:** `git push origin my-awesome-powertoy`
   * **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original `ChromePowerToys` repository on GitHub and you'll see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch.
        * Fill out the PR template clearly, explaining what your changes do and why.
        * Link to any relevant GitHub Issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
   * **Code Review:** Maintainers and other community members will review your PR. Be open to feedback and discussion!
   * **Merge:** Once approved, your contribution will be merged! üéâ

**6. Other Ways to Contribute:**
   * **Documentation:** Improve this README, our Roadmap, or write documentation for individual PowerToys.
   * **Testing & Feedback:** Use the developing PowerToys and report bugs or suggest improvements by opening issues.
   * **UI/UX Design:** Help design intuitive interfaces for the PowerToys.
   * **Spread the Word:** Tell others about the project!
