# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT YOUR PROJECT EMAIL OR CONTACT METHOD HERE - e.g., your.email@example.com].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and not all of them involve writing code!

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in one of the PowerToys:
1.  **Search existing issues:** Check if the bug has already been reported on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys/issues).
2.  **If not found, create a new issue:** Use the "Bug Report" template if available. Provide as much detail as possible:
    * Steps to reproduce the bug.
    * Expected behavior.
    * Actual behavior.
    * Screenshots or GIFs if helpful.
    * Your Chrome version and Operating System.
    * The specific PowerToy and its version (if applicable).

### Suggesting Enhancements or New PowerToys
Have an idea for a new PowerToy or an improvement to an existing one?
1.  **Check the [Project Roadmap](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md):** See if your idea aligns with our existing plans or if something similar is already listed.
2.  **Open a "Feature Request" issue:** Clearly describe your idea, its benefits, and potential implementation thoughts. This allows for community discussion.

### Working on Existing Issues
1.  Browse the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys/issues).
2.  Look for issues tagged `help wanted`, `good first issue`, or `status:todo`.
3.  Comment on the issue to indicate you'd like to work on it. This helps avoid duplicated effort.
4.  If it's a larger feature, discuss your proposed approach in the issue before starting significant coding.

### Submitting Code Contributions
This is the core of building new PowerToys!
1.  Follow the [Setting Up Your Development Environment](#setting-up-your-development-environment) guide below.
2.  Adhere to our [Coding Style & Conventions](#coding-style--conventions) and [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
3.  Ensure your PowerToy is **safe, secure, and easy to use**. Request minimal permissions.
4.  Include or update relevant documentation for your contribution.
5.  Submit a [Pull Request](#pull-request-process) with your changes.

### Improving Documentation
Clear documentation is crucial. You can help by:
* Improving this `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
* Enhancing the main `README.md`.
* Adding or improving the `README.md` for individual PowerToys.
* Correcting typos or clarifying instructions.

### Providing Feedback
Your feedback on existing PowerToys, ideas, and the project direction is highly valuable. Participate in discussions on GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of `ChromePowerToys` by clicking the "Fork" button on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys.git)
    cd ChromePowerToys
    ```
3.  **Set Upstream Remote (Optional but Recommended):** This helps keep your fork synced with the main repository.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChromePowerToys.git) 
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the upstream URL with the actual owner of the main ChromePowerToys repository if it's not you.)*
4.  **Create a New Branch:** Before making changes, create a descriptive branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-powertoy 
    # or fix/bug-in-xyz-powertoy
    ```
5.  **Develop Your PowerToy:**
    * Each PowerToy will typically be a Chrome extension in its own subdirectory (e.g., `code_examples/my_powertoy/`).
    * Follow standard Chrome extension development practices (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, `manifest.json`).
    * Load your extension as "unpacked" in `chrome://extensions` (with Developer Mode enabled) for testing.

## Coding Style & Conventions

* **JavaScript:** We generally follow modern JavaScript (ES6+) practices. Consider using a linter like ESLint with a common style guide (e.g., Airbnb, StandardJS - to be decided and configured).
* **HTML/CSS:** Write clean, semantic HTML and well-organized CSS.
* **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.
* **Readability:** Prioritize clear and readable code.
* **Permissions:** Only request the minimum permissions necessary for your PowerToy to function. Clearly justify why each permission is needed in the PowerToy's documentation or PR.
* **AI Integration:** If using LLMs (preferably Google Gemini):
    * Clearly indicate to the user when AI is being used and what data is being sent.
    * Handle API keys securely (e.g., users provide their own keys in settings, do not hardcode keys).
    * Minimize data sent to the LLM.

*(More detailed style guides might be added later.)*

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use a commit message template (`.gitmessage.txt`) to encourage consistent and informative commit messages. Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Basic Format:**
[optional scope]: [optional body][optional footer(s)]Example: `feat(summarizer): Add option for summary length`

If you haven't configured the template locally, refer to the `.gitmessage.txt` file in the project root.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure your code lints (if a linter is set up) and any tests pass.
2.  Update your fork's branch with the latest changes from the main repository's `main` branch (rebase if possible to keep history clean):
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main 
    # or git merge upstream/main
    ```
3.  Push your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-powertoy
    ```
4.  Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the official `ChromePowerToys` repository.
5.  **Fill out the PR template thoroughly:**
    * Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
    * Explain the "why" and "what" of your contribution.
    * Link to any relevant GitHub Issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    * Include screenshots or GIFs if your changes affect the UI.
6.  Be prepared for a code review and respond to feedback constructively.
7.  Once your PR is approved and passes any checks, it will be merged!
